# Mapping apps for profitability at the App Store and Play Store

According to Knowband the mobile app market is growing fast, and just to have an idea of how big this industry is, it's believed that its economy numbers will be around $188.9B by 2020. In this scenario, regardless of the app monetization model, data analysis of app profiles can help in improving the profitability of the business.

This project is about understanding data and using the knowledge acquired in this process to improve business strategy. The two data sets used here are from App Store and Google Play. We will focus on free English apps, trying to understand what type of apps would probably attract more users.

Using data analytics made it possible to map the profile of English free apps from App Store and Play Store. From the knowledge of the most common apps and most popular ones, was possible to suggest three promising ideas to build new apps for both markets using the concept of gamification: 
* (i) an app that proposes to make the search for shows on Netflix less painfull while integrates another functionalities, 
* (ii) an app that would work as a social network for mums share what they want about their babies and 
* (iii) an app to help the fight against dengue disease. 

Besides that, the suggested apps have a strong social-network DNA what could make them funny and addictive to the users.

As expected, most of the time was consumed in cleaning the data. In addition, data visualization with Matplotlib make the analysis easier.
